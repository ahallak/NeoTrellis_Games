A simple memory game for the Adafruit NeoTrellis. Runs on CircuitPython 8.2.9
## Instructions
1. Get CircuitPython running on your device [https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython]
2. Copy code.py and memory_game.py to the root of the CIRCUITPY drive
3. Make sure the correct I2C bus is selected, depending on how your NeoTrellis is connected
4. Play away!

   Note, I haven't yet tried using multiple NeoTrellis modules with this yet.
